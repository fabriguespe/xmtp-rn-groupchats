# Group chat tutorial with React Native

This tutorial will guide you through implementing group chat functionality in your XMTP inbox, covering creation, message sending, streaming, and member management.

:::caution

This project is in **Alpha** status and ready for you to experiment with.

However, we do not recommend using **Alpha** software in production apps. Software in this status is likely to change based on feedback.

<h3>Installation Steps</h3></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or Yarn
- React Native CLI
- Xcode (for iOS)

### 1. Initialize react native project

If you haven't already created a React Native project, start by initializing one:

```bash
npx react-native init xmtprn
```

### 2. Install expo modules

Install the latest Expo modules:

```bash
npx install-expo-modules@latest
```

### 3. Install XMTP react native sdk

Install the XMTP React Native SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install @xmtp/react-native-sdk
```

### 4. Update podfile for ios

Update the Podfile to set the minimum iOS platform. Open the `Podfile` in your iOS directory and modify the platform line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '16.0'
```

### 5. Update xcode target

Ensure your Xcode project's target is updated to iOS 16.0 or higher.

### 6. Add Babel plugin

Install the Babel plugin required for the XMTP SDK:

```bash
npm add @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from
```

### 7. Configure babel

Update your Babel configuration. Open your `babel.config.js` and add the plugin:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from'],
};
```

### 8. Install ios pods

Navigate to the iOS directory and install the necessary pods:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### 9. Start the application

Finally, start your React Native application:

```bash
npm run ios
```

### Creating a group chat

To create a group chat, you can use the GroupChat class. When a user initiates a new group chat, you should collect the participants' addresses and create a new instance of GroupChat.

```jsx
const createGroupChat = participants => {
  const groupChat = await client.conversations.newGroup([addresses]);
  selectConversation(groupChat); // Assuming you have a method to select the current conversation
};
```

### Loading all group chats

:::caution
Remember to `syncGroups()` chats to ensure you have the latest data.
:::

To load conversations including group chats, you can modify the ListConversations component to fetch and display both direct and group conversations. Assuming your backend or SDK supports a .list() method that can filter for group chats, you would integrate it as follows:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchConversations = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    //First fetch new groups from the network
    await client.conversations.syncGroups();
    //Get groups from local DB
    const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups();
    setConversations(allGroups);
    setLoading(false);
  };

  fetchConversations();
}, []);
```

### Sending a message in a group chat

To send a message in a group chat, you can use the sendMessage method of the GroupChat class. Ensure you check if the current conversation is a group chat before sending the message.

```jsx
const handleSendMessage = async newMessage => {
  if (!newMessage.trim()) {
    alert('Empty message');
    return;
  }
  if (group && group.version === 'GROUP') {
    await group.send(newMessage);
  } else if (group && group.peerAddress) {
    // Handle sending a direct message
  }
};
```

### Loading group chat messages

Here's a simplified example of how you might use `group.messages()` to load and display messages from a group chat:

:::caution Group chats are currently per installation
As of now, group chats in XMTP are specific to each installation. This means that while you can access your group chat conversations across different devices, the historical messages within those chats might not automatically appear. Currently, each group chat's message history is tied to the device where it was initiated. As a result, there is no automatic syncing of message history across devices. When you sign in on a new device, you will see existing group chat conversations but will only receive new messages from that point forward. We are actively working on enhancing this feature to improve your experience with group conversations.
:::

```
useEffect(() => {
  const loadGroupMessages = async () => {
    if (conversation && conversation.version === 'GROUP') {
      try {
        setIsLoading(true);
        // Assuming `conversation` is an instance of a GroupChat
        // Fetch the latest 20 messages from the group chat
        const messages = await conversation.messages({ limit: 20 });
        setMessages(messages.reverse()); // Reverse the messages to display the latest at the bottom
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load group messages:', error);
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    }
  };

  loadGroupMessages();
}, [conversation]);
```

### Listening for new messages

To stream messages from a group chat, you can use the streamMessages method. This method should be called when the group chat is selected to ensure real-time message updates.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (conversation.version === 'GROUP') {
    const startMessageStream = async () => {
      conversation.streamGroupMessages((message, includeGroups = true) => {
        setMessages(prevMessages => [...prevMessages, message]);
      });
    };
    startMessageStream();
  }
}, [conversation]);
```

### Manage group chat members

:::caution
Remember to `sync()` chats to ensure you have the latest data.
:::

To add or remove members from a group chat, you can use the `addMembers` and `removeMember` methods provided by the GroupChat class.
Adding a Member

```jsx
const addMemberToGroupChat = memberAddress => {
  if (selectedConversation.version === 'GROUP') {
    //Update the member
    selectedConversation.addMembers([memberAddress]);
    //First fetch latest data from the network
    await selectedConversation.sync();
    //Update state
    setMembers(await selectedConversation.memberAddresses());
  }
};
```

Removing a Member

```jsx
const removeMemberFromGroupChat = memberAddress => {
  if (selectedConversation.version === 'GROUP') {
    //Update the member
    selectedConversation.removeMembers([memberAddress]);
    //First fetch latest data from the network
    await selectedConversation.sync();
    //Update state
    setMembers(await selectedConversation.memberAddresses());
  }
};
```

Get member addresses

```jsx
const getGroupMemberAddresses = () => {
  if (selectedConversation.version === 'GROUP') {
    //First fetch latest data from the network
    await selectedConversation.sync();
    //Get member addresses
    const memberAddresses = await selectedConversation.memberAddresses();
    console.log('Group Member Addresses:', memberAddresses);
    return memberAddresses;
  } else {
    console.log('Not a group chat.');
    return [];
  }
};
```

## Note on conversations and messages in group chats

It's important to note that all the features and methods described in the [Conversations](/docs/build/conversations.md) and [Messages](/docs/build/messages/messages.md) documentation are fully applicable to group chats as well. This includes starting new conversations, checking if an address is on the network, sending messages, and listing existing conversations. XMTP design ensures that you can manage group chats with the same ease and flexibility as one-on-one conversations.
